                    <p class = textCardBody>In this project, I scraped real estate listings from Apartments.com for the Jacksonville area using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. After collecting the data, I cleaned and processed it, extracting geospatial information with Geopy's ArcGIS.

                        To visualize key trends, I created scatter plots with different hues representing variables such as price, number of bedrooms, and square footage. I then applied K-means clustering to group the apartments into distinct Jacksonville neighborhoods and labeled them accordingly. To investigate price differences between these clusters, I conducted an ANOVA test followed by post-hoc analysis.
                        
                        I also used KDE plots to examine apartment density across the city and within individual neighborhoods. Lastly, I built predictive models to estimate rental prices based on square footage and coordinates, testing several modeling approaches.
                        
                        The project concluded with insights on where the average citizen of this area might find affordable housing in Jacksonville.</p>

                        The analysis provided valuable insights into Jacksonvilleâ€™s rental market. The K-means clustering successfully grouped apartments into distinct neighborhoods, revealing patterns in pricing and availability. The ANOVA test confirmed statistically significant price differences between these clusters, while post-hoc analysis identified which neighborhoods were more affordable. KDE plots highlighted areas with the highest apartment density, offering a clear visual representation of rental hotspots. Finally, the predictive models, with Random Forest performing best, provided accurate price estimates based on square footage and location, helping to identify cost-effective housing options for recent graduates like myself.

                    <p class = textCardBody>This project focused on predicting the specific gravity of potatoes, which is closely related to starch content, using Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy data. Specific gravity is a key quality indicator in potatoes, traditionally measured through labor-intensive methods. To automate this process, I built a machine learning pipeline to analyze the spectral data and estimate specific gravity values.Key steps included preprocessing the NIR data using Savitzky-Golay derivatives and Multiple Scatter Correction (MSC) to reduce noise and improve signal quality. For feature reduction, I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering to group similar spectral profiles. The predictive model was built using Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, which was evaluated through cross-validation to ensure robustness.</p>

                        While the model was successfully developed and the data pipeline established, the results did not reveal a clear correlation between the NIR spectra and specific gravity in this dataset. Potential factors such as excessive noise, incorrect data collection processes, or suboptimal wavelength selection likely impacted the modelâ€™s performance. Despite these challenges, the system has been fully set up, meaning that when more accurate data becomes available in the next season, it can be seamlessly integrated to produce reliable predictions.
